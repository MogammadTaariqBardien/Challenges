        I was busy at work and was swamped with the amount of things that I had to do.
        It was <strong>not intentional</strong> but I know it meant alot to you so I offer my <strong>deepest apologizes</strong> and hope that <strong>I can make it up to you.</strong>
        I will make the evening so that you <strong>cannot forget it.</strong>
